# K-Means-clustering-using-python
K-means groups similar data points together into clusters by minimizing the mean distance between geometric points. To do so, it iteratively partitions datasets into a fixed number (the K) of non-overlapping subgroups (or clusters) wherein each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean cluster center.
